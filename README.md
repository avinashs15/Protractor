# Protractor
This sample framework is written using Protractor, Javascript and npm modules.
User needs to install all the required modules before Execution.
The conf.js is the starting point which controles the execution of the test cases.

How to start with installation and write first test case : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GDFc77rex-Fqf1B8wosrxk1DePe4qt7-HzpZxyzXzeI/edit

User needs to install the packages specified in the ../FunctionalTests/package.json file

Features of the framework

1. Reporting using protractor-pretty-html-reporter which automatically generates an html reporter and the report will be generated under ./FunctionalTests/src/tests/Execution Results folder
2. Utilities.js has many time bond, string manipulation, random generators , csv and json utilities, browser switch tabs etc
3. Page object model implementation : All the pages will be under ./FunctionalTests/src/tests/Pages and the spec files will be under ./FunctionalTests/src/tests/Specs
4. Handling data : The data required is stored under ./FunctionalTests/src/tests/Data folder. All the data will be stored in the json file and it can be retrived either in test cases or in the spec files.
5. Design pattern : page object model using data and key driven hybrid design.

Executing the test cases :
The execution is controlled by ./FunctionalTests/src/tests/conf.js file.
The test cases under 	specs: ['./Specs/*.js'], // Relative path to the spec file will all be executed
if the user wants to execute specific test cases, he can specify the spec file name under Specs/
